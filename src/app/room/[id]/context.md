so user clicks create room
needs to spin up a sendable link
-- what does that link do?
it invites someone else to the game room
so the link by going to create game room link, it should create a new id, a uuid, based on the user
and that becomes part of the link to share
then if someone navigates to that link
it somehow adds them both to the same room
eek
